# Stripe Account Management Features

## What Was Added

### Part 1: Fixed "Stuck Onboarding" Issue âœ…

**Problem:** Once a coach started Stripe onboarding (even if they didn't finish), the "Continue Onboarding" banner disappeared forever.

**Solution:**
- Created `/api/stripe/account-status` endpoint that checks REAL Stripe account status
- Updated Dashboard to check if `charges_enabled` is true (not just if account exists)
- Banner now shows until Stripe setup is actually complete

**Result:** Coaches who time out or close the Stripe onboarding can now complete it later!

### Part 2: Added Stripe Account Management Page âœ…

**New Page:** `/my-profile/payments`

**Features:**
1. **View Stripe Account Status**
   - Connection status (Connected/Not Connected)
   - Payment status (Enabled/Setup Required)
   - Bank account info (last 4 digits)
   - Account details (email, country, currency)

2. **Actions**
   - "Connect Stripe Account" (for new coaches)
   - "Complete Stripe Setup" (for incomplete setups)
   - "Open Stripe Dashboard" (for existing accounts)

3. **Navigation**
   - Added tabs to My Profile page (Profile Info | Payment Settings)
   - Only visible to coaches

## New API Endpoints

### 1. `/api/stripe/account-status` (GET)
- Returns detailed Stripe account status
- Checks `charges_enabled`, `details_submitted`, `payouts_enabled`
- Shows bank account info (last 4)
- Requires authentication

### 2. `/api/stripe/dashboard-link` (POST)
- Generates a login link to Stripe Express Dashboard
- Allows coaches to update banking info, view payouts, etc.
- Link opens in new tab
- Requires authentication

## Database Migration Required

**File:** `supabase/migrations/012_fix_coaches_table_insert_policy.sql`

**What it does:**
- Adds RLS policies so coaches can INSERT/UPDATE/SELECT their own coach records
- Fixes the "42501: insufficient privilege" error

**How to run:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `012_fix_coaches_table_insert_policy.sql`
3. Run the SQL
4. Done!
